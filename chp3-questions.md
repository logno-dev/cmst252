27. Why is data compression an important topic today?
> While in the past, the need to keep data small was due to limited storage capacity, the modern restraint and need for compression is due to data sharing and the bandwidth of our networking systems.

28. What is the difference between lossless and lossy data compression?
> Lossless means that data can be retreived without losing any information, where lossy indicates that some amount of information is lost in the process of compaction.

29. Why do computers have difficulty with analog information?
> Analogue data is directly proportional to the continuous, infinite world around us. Digitizing data means that we must break the information into pieces and represent those pieces individually.

30. Is a clock with a sweeping second hand an analog device or a digital device? Explain.
> A clock with a sweeping second hand would be an analog device as there is an infinite resolution of positions the second hand may be in as it circles the clock.

31. What does it mean to digitize something?
> To break analgous information into pieces that may be represented by a digital data point.

33. How many things can be represented with

- a. Four bits? 16
- b. Five bits? 32
- c. Six bits? 64
- d. Seven bits? 128

40. Evaluate the following expressions, where A is 11111110 and B is 00000010, using two's compliment.

- a. A + B
> 00000000
- b. A - B
> 11111100
- c. B - A
> 00000100
- d. -B
> 11111110
- e. - (-A)
> 11111110

44. Convert the following real numbers to binary (five binary places).

- a. 0.50
> .1
- b. 0.26
> .01000
- c. 0.10
> .00011

47. How many bits would be needed to represent a character set containing 45 characters? Why?
> 45 converted to binary is 101101 which contains 6 bits, therefor, a minimum of 6 bits would be required to represent a character set containing 45 characters.

49. What is the main difference between the ASCII and Unicode character sets?
> ASCII uses 8-bit encoding where Unicode uses 16-bit encoding. This allows Unicode to account for vastly more characters and allowing for the accommodation of characters beyond those typically found in the English language.

56. What is an RGB value?
> Red, green and blue values. It is a system of 3 numbers that represent each colors contribution value to the final color. Each color can have a contribution value of 0-255.

61. Define sampling as it relates to digitizing sound waves.
> An analogue signal varies in voltage continuosly. Sampling refers to the process of periodically measuring the voltage of the signal and recording the appropriate numeric value.

72. Name two types of video compression?
> Temporal compression and Spatial compression
