For Exercises 18-29, match the gate with the description of the operation or the deagram.

- A. AND
- B. NAND
- C. XOR
- D. OR
- E. NOR
- F. NOT

18. Inverts its input.
> F. NOT

19. Produces a 1 only if all its inputs are 1 and a 0 otherwise
> A. AND

20. Produces a 0 only if all its inputs are 0 and a 1 otherwise
> D. OR

21. Produces a 0 only if its inputs are the same and a 1 otherwise
> C. XOR

22. Produces a 0 if all its inputs are 1 and a 1 otherwise
> B. NAND

23. Produces a 1 if all its inputs are 0 and a 0 otherwise
> E. NOR

24. _image_
> F. NOT

25. _image_
> A. AND

26. _image_
> D. OR

27. _image_

28. _image_
> B. NAND

29. _image_
> E. NOR

32. What are the three notational methods for describing the behavior of gates and circuits?
> Boolean expressions, Logic diagrams, Truth table

43. Give the Boolean expression for a three-input AND gate, and then show its behavior with a truth table.
> A x B x C
> | A    | B    | C    | X    |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    |
| 0    | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 0 | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 1 | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1 | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1 | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1 | 1   | 1   | 1   |


44. Give the Boolean expression for a three-input OR gate, and then show its behavior with a truth table.

46. How does transistor behave?

55. Draw a circuit diagram corresponding to the following Boolean expressions: (A + B)(B + C)
