For Exercises 1-10, choose from the following list of people:

- A. Leibniz
- B. Pascal
- C. Babbage
- D. Lovelace
- E. Hollerith
- F. Byron
- G. Turing
- H. Jacquard

1. What French mathematician built and sold the first gear-driven mechanical machine that did addition and subtraction?
   - B. Pascal
2. Who built the first mechanical machine that did addition, subtraction multiplication, and division?
   - A. Leibniz
3. Who designed the first mechanical machine that included memory?
   - C. Babbage
4. Who was considered the first programmer?
   - D. Lovelace
5. Who proposed that a punched card be used for counting the census?
   - E. Hollerith
6. Who edited Babbage's work?
   - D. Lovelace
7. Who was Ada Lovelace's father?
   - F. Byron
8. Who would have been mentioned in the book the _Code Breakers_?
   - G. Turing
9. Who developed the concept of punched holes used in weaving cloth?
   - H. Jacquard
10. Who is associated with IBM?
    - E. Hollerith

48. Define the word abstraction and relate it to the drawing in Figure 1.2.
    - A mental model that removes complex details; a model of a complex system that includes only the details essential to the user. Figure 1.2 depicts a car engine. Abstraction can be related to a car engine because the inner workings of a car engine are not necessary for the user to understand. The user must only understand basic functions to operate a vehicle such as pressing the gas pedal, turning the steering wheel, or operating the gear shaft. The user does not need to understand how combustion drives pistons which translates to rotation of an axle via a gear box.
50. Define the word *protocol* and explain how it is used in computing.
    - A protocol is a set of rules that defines how data is formatted and processed on a network. Protocols ensure that communication between devices or between technologies can be executed successfully via some form of standardization.
51. Distinguish the difference between machine language and assembly language.
    - Machine language is represented as binary (0's and 1's) and can be read directly by CPU. Assembly language is a set of instructions that is relatively human readable that can be translated directly to binary.
52. Distinguish between assembly language and high-level languages.
    - The gaps between machine language and assembly language involves a level of abstraction. Similarly, the gaps between assembly and high-level languages have even further levels of abstraction. High-level languages provide human readable syntax and core functions that combine a series of basic logical functions.
55. Distinguish between a systems programmer and an applications programmer.
    - Systems programmers wrote tools such as assemblers and compilers. Applications programmers were those who used those tools to create applications for typical users.
56. What was the rationale behind the development of operating systems?
    - As hardware advanced, it became apparent that the human element was slowing down the capabilities of the hardware. Computers were sitting idle waiting for instructions to execute. Operating systems allowed the computer to determine what to run and when.
58. What do the following pieces of software do?
    - a. Loader - Loaded programs into memory.
    - b. Linker - Linked pieces of large programs together.
    - c. Editor - Allows the programmer to edit plain text files.
