24. Define the following terms:

   a. Core 2 processor

      > A processor with 2 cores built into one chip to allow simultaneous processing.

   b. Hertz

      > A measurement of frequency. CPU manufactures refer to the CPU's maximum clock frequency in a measurement of Hertz.

   c. Random access memory

      > A form of memory that is quickly accessable to the CPU. This form of memory is situatated physically closer to the CPU on the board and does not maintain data when the computer is powered down.


25. What does FSB stand for?

> Front-side bus. A communication interface that connects the CPU to the main memor and other system components.

26. What does it mean to say that a processor is 1.4 GHz?

> GHz is shorthand for gigahertz which is equivalent to one billion hertz. So a CPU that is 1.4GHz has a maximum clock speed of 1.4 billion Hertz, more specifically the CPU cycles 1.4 billion times every second.

27. What does it mean to say that memory is 133 MHz?

> MHz is shorthand for megahertz which is equivalent to 1 million Hertz. So memory that is 133 MHz can be read/write 133 million times per second.

29. Define RPM and discuss what it means in terms of speed of access to a disk.

> RPM is shorthand for Rotations Per Minute. In terms of speed of access to a disk, this this means that the phsyical disk in the hard drive can spin up to the stated speed in RPM. The higher the RPM the faster data can be accessed within the hard drive disks.

30.What is the stored-program concept, and why is it important?

> A concept introduced by John Von Neumann where programs and data are stored in a seperate storage units called memories and are treated the same.

32. Name the components of a von Neumann machine.

   - Input
   - Output
   - Processing Unit
   - Memory
   - Control Unit

34. What is the function of the ALU?

> Arithmetic-logic unit. It is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logical operations.

37. What is an instruction register, and what is its function?

> And instruction register is an element in the CPU that holds the programming instructions that will be executed at the start of the next clock cycle as dictated by other parts of the CPU.

38. What is a program counter, and what is its function?

> A program counter is a register in the CPU which has the address of the next instructino to be executed from memory. It is a digital counter needed for faster execution of tasks as well as for tracking the current execution point.

39. List the steps in the fetch-execute cycle.

   1. Fetch
   2. Decode
   3. Execute
   4. Store
